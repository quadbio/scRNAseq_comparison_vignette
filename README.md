# Tutorial of condition comparison analysis of scRNA-seq data
This tutorial is about how to compare scRNA-seq data representing different experimental conditions. It includes three parts:
1. The analysis to the example data set in order to get a universal annotation for the following analysis;
2. How to compare the cell type/state/cluster compositions between two different conditions;
3. How to do differential expression analysis focusing on one cell type/state/cluster of interest.

The example data set used in this tutorial is a part of the data from the preprint paper [Inferring and perturbing cell fate regulomes in human cerebral organoids](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.457460v1).

If you are a beginner of scRNA-seq data analysis, you can check the other tutorial "[Tutorial for scRNA-seq data analysis beginners using R](https://github.com/quadbiolab/scRNAseq_analysis_vignette)".

Please contact Dr. Zhisong He (zhisong.he(at)bsse.ethz.ch) or Prof. Barbara Treutlein (barbara.treutlein(at)bsse.ethz.ch) if there is any question.
